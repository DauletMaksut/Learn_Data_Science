0,0,Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night     One of them sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield was all but blown out of the water by US Warships on Monday     The Iranian platform an unsightly mass of steel and concrete was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60 metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four US Destroyers pumped some 1000 shells into it     The US Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section of the structure remained     US helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and US forces attacked seized and sank an Iranian ship they said had been caught laying mines     But Iran was not deterred according to US defense officials who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm missiles to hit a US-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday and the Sea Isle City on Friday     Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait a key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran     Henry Schuler a former US diplomat in the Middle East now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping     But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result of US intervention and Iran's response     The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a US "tit-for-tat" policy that gave Iran the initiative said Harlan Ullman an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS     He said with this appraoch America would suffer "the death of one thousand cuts"     But for the United States to grab the initiative militarily it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its shipping must pass Schuler said     He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing Iran to the neogtiating table If vital supplies were cut off Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq     Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate     He said the United States should also threaten to mine and blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a settlement     Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by invading Iran's territory in 1980 Iraq blames Iran for the outbreak of hostilities which have entailed World War I-style infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties     Each side has attacked the others' shipping  Reuter 
0,1,A US attack on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab allies Western diplomats in the region said     US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that US Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf in response to a missile strike on the American-registered Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday     "We consider the matter closed" he said a signal the US administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate     Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day against exacerbating the Gulf crisis saying military action would endanger American interests     Following the raid a okesman for Tehran's War Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a "crushing blow"     "The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying     Diplomats noted however Iran was also seeking to avoid ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war     Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in Damascus and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran     Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering they said     "The ball is in Iran's court now It's up to Tehran to respond one way or the other" a diplomat said     President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American countermeasures if the military escalation continued     Western diplomats and military sources in the area said shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act the United States could have taken once it had decided to retaliate for the tanker attack blamed by both the Americans and Kuwaitis on Iran     "It's interesting that they chose something in international waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation" one diplomat said "This was better for US Relations with the Gulf Arab states particularly Kuwait"     Commented another diplomat: "Kuwait must be happy that the US Has done something but relieved that Faw was not attacked on its doorstep"     One source said of the attack on the oil platform: "They managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the least nuisance to everybody"     A diplomat commented: "They were very clever in the place they chose It gets attention but it hasn't devastated anything because it wasn't working in the first place"     A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke: "This was a good measured response without risking a flare-up  It is a face-saving response (for the Americans)"  Reuter 

0,4,Military experts say the United States faces a dilemma in the Gulf following US destruction of an Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a US-flagged tanker     The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching limited retaliatory strikes     But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps -- such as mining Iran's harbors blockading its shipping or destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war     "Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the cycle of attack and retaliation continues" said Fred Axelgard a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)     "It's like a Greek tragedy" said retired Adm Eugene Carroll of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI) think tank     Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq     They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its 30-ship force from the Gulf area where the Navy began escorting US-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July Withdrawal would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran which President Reagan could never accept     US Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon news conference the destroyers Kidd Young Leftwich and Hoel fired about 1000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf time (0700 EDT) on Monday     Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian Silkworm missile strike on the US-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City on Friday     Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and allowed to escape     "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures" Weinberger said     "We consider this matter closed" he said     Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives agreed the US reaction was measured reasonable and did not escalate the conflict unduly But they said the question was whether Iran would consider the matter closed It had not taken this view after earlier clashes  Reuter 

0,261,Karl Otto Poehl head of West Germany's central bank and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central bank's independence     But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl president of the Bundesbank and Stoltenberg over a controversial investment tax proposal has added to the woes of the country's already nervous financial markets bankers said     Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates     Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's criticism saying West Germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors     "The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors" said one economist for a London broker who asked not to be identified     Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through a particularly difficult time     "There are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill feeling" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister     News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad     Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the Bundesbank adequately and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market     Both Poehl 57 and Stoltenberg 59 have been under extraordinary pressures lately     Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy Helmut Schlesinger jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability     In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like Schlesinger For years the softly-spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices     Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank council and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his views bankers said     "Poehl is in a minority in his own house" said Commerzbank's Pfister     "Poehl is in a dilemma He must follow a policy that is not entirely his own" said another economist     The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far they will attract funds into the country pushing up the mark and hurting West German exporters     The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October     Since last Thursday United States Treasury Secretary James Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases     Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986 war of words between the US And West Germany in which US Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more US Exports     One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990     But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for Stoltenberg than he had bargained for     The cool unflappable northerner who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts     The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising 43 billion marks     But it has caused an outcry among bankers who say it will push up borrowing costs The extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in     Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row which has turned into the country's worst political scandal     Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last month early to sort out a row in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein where he heads the ruling CDU party     The state's CDU premier Uwe Barschel had to resign after allegations of a "dirty tricks" election campaign led to heavy losses for the CDU in state elections     Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last weekend Police say the death appears to have been suicide     Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats and was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt     When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this year Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government gave Poehl another eight-year term     Werner Chrobok managing partner at Bethmann Bank said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again     But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the Bundesbank's independence of government Chrobok said  REUTER 

0,311,Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues government and private economists said     A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy they said     Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 25 pct discount rate many in the markets have thought otherwise     Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills dealers said     But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15 pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation dealers and economists said     Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount rate increase     A senior government economist suggested that both the US And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices "They need to support the stock and security markets" he said     But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week     Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago     With the economy recovering strongly the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence one government economist said     "There will be some impact on the real economy but it won't be that big" said another     Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles And while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year's economic downturn the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses he said     Paradoxically it is the pick-up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending one government economist said     In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation one central bank official said "That will at least take a couple of days if not weeks" he said  REUTER 

0,350,A voluntary compliance system for monitoring US coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry said analysts and trade sources     "Many sectors of the trade including large roasters and importers are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other" one analyst said     On Monday a National Coffee Association newsletter said the Office of US Trade Representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill     Under the arrangement milar to one in 1980 coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the US government until Congress approves the monitoring authority but if coffee arrives without valid certification it will still be allowed entry     While many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the US others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls trade sources said     "Last time there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines" a US Customs spokesman said     "Customs can do a good job when given the tools but when its hands are tied it doesn't have the authority to demand Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to destination)" he said     Many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system     "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement" said one major US roaster      "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement the trade did not act as a gentleman" said another analyst adding "without the need to submit documents the ball will be in the producers' hands"     Some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member countries at discounts and then bring it into the US falsely labelled     According to customs officials several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans     "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions" said Paine Webber analyst Bernie Savaiko     Still others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the US in the near term     "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance but I think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee I don't think that it poses that much of a threat" one trader said  Reuter 

0,385,US And West German reaffirmation of support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the current collapse in stock markets London economists said     "There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the dollar is going to be allowed to slip" said Richard Jeffrey of Hoare Govett "If not there is going to be continued fear that when pressure emerges on the dollar the Fed will be forced to tighten This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the US With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world"     But some economists added that Wall Street's crash which dragged other major markets down with it may help curb the very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent US Trade deficits     "If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide" said Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel echoing comments from other London and Tokyo analysts     Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth curbing inflationary pressures and import demand in the US They say     Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson     "It would be suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their interest rates" he added     Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a point to 925 pct Tuesday and US Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial system     The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy via a banking crisis for example thus precipitating recession     It also helped the dollar rally sharply to a high of 18200 marks from a European low of 17880 But economists said today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in mind     "The United States has been able to live on borrowed time If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic growth not recessionIt contains good news (and) provides a more realistic assessment of the US Economy" said Capel's Dennis But he added that markets are still very much in danger     "The liquidity doesn't disappearAll it's doing is disappearing from the equity markets" Dennis noted     David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies is still on     Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency stability     But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad said Morrison "The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived To stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong" he said  Reuter 

0,387,An unexpectedly heavy 44 billion stg surge in UK September sterling bank lending is unlikely to nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as long as sterling remains in its present robust state economists said     An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit demand which has largely been behind growth in lending     "In the normal course of events the markets would have been extremely worried about that figure" noted Peter Spencer UK Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston     After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data which compared won stg August rise UK Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee from plummetting equities into the relative security of government securities     Equity markets dropped sharply on the news touching a day's low of 17667 on the FTSE 100 index after the data before staging a recovery Sterling held its buoyant tone throughout     UK Money market rates in a similarly calm response resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning after little more than a token blip as the figures came out     Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct "With the financial markets doing what they're doing that's the last thing the Bank of England would want to do" Spencer said     "The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as sterling is firm the authorities are unlikely to put rates up" said Kevin Boakes chief UK Economist at Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money measure M0 to 52 pct year-on-year from August's 45 pct growth which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury     But "The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed down is a rather encouraging sign" noted Paul Temperton UK Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets He pointed to a fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money aggregate to 195 pct in September from August's 22 pct     It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank of England to engineer a one point rise in UK Bank base rates to 10 pct in early August caution endorsed subsequently by news of a massive 49 billion stg July rise in bank lending     Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in that period had been the behaviour of UK Asset markets     Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in influencing consumer behaviour he said     In the light of the precipitous falls on UK Equity markets in the past few days "There will almost certainly be a straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail sales" Temperton said     "Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues" he added     "I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending figure is a thing of the pastWe are talking about a very serious panic and a flight to quality" Spencer said     A UK Treasury official said that it was important to look at all the monetary information not just the bank lending adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly than bank lending     Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy personal sector borrowing     Figures from the Banking Information Service showed personal sector lending by UK Clearing banks rose by 166 billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise Much of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments  REUTER 

0,393,Norway's September oil output rose by 222 pct to 107 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830492 bpd in August according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here     Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field rescue project     Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's voluntary move to curb by 75 pct planned growth in its oil output a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets     Norway not an OPEC member decided in June to extend the production restraints enforced since February 1 1987 on all its North Sea fields for the rest of the year     Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth     The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field which pumped 168023 bpd in September against 48195 bpd in August field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said     Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields which use the Ekofisk pipeline were shut down for most of August while Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence     BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd operator of the Ula field said September output rose to 86727 bpd after dropping to 27237 bpd in August because of the shutdown     Valhall operated by Amoco Norway A/S flowed 74694 bpd last month compared with 69748 bpd in August the company said     September production was also sharply higher at the Statfjord field Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord which extends into the British North Sea sector was 611138 bpd against 552646 bpd in August operator Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said     Norway's 222 pct share of the Murchison field which like Statfjord extends into the British sector yielded 15388 bpd in September a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous month Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said     Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109670 bpd in September compared with 100188 in August     Norsk Hydro operator of the Oseberg field said test output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl totalled 1719 bpd last month down sharply from 16170 bpd in August     Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on stream a second well cutting September production to just two days  REUTER 

0,509,The United States appears to have won a transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest rates European economists said     But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were plunging     West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and US Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt according to official statements released late Monday     Only 13 hours after the statements were released the Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 380 pct down from a 385 pct facility rate offered last week     While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl the central bank had also added money market liquidity repeatedly signalling it did not want a strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday      "It's round one to the Americans " said Richard Reid senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in London     But Reid added "We shouldn't forget that it has taken one of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 005 percentage point"     Over the weekend criticism by Baker of earlier tightening of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid     Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary policies It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven - the US Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada     The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading in New York At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday the dollar was quoted at 17918 marks compared with 17740 on Monday     Guenther Aschoff chief economist at Deutsche Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West German short-term interest rates on Tuesday     "The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market losses That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits with Baker's wishes then all the better" he said     No central bank wants to let interest rates rise and the Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises in the US Aschoff said     Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern     Giles Keating economist with Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London said "The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat and Baker has won a battleBut he hasn't won the war as the security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was before the IMF meeting last month in Washington"     Before the IMF meeting when the Louvre Accord was reaffirmed the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity at 360 pct Keating noted     Economists said the United States now appeared to have agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates     Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit Stoltenberg told a news conference on Tuesday He added he would not rule out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value     Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency stability In addition both the US And West German central banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar  REUTER 

0,512,The European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group EC officials said     Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat fish and cereals by-products     But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again the officials said     The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef     Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes but they were outvoted by the other states the officials said Under the deal Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4500 tonnes to 34300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3000 tonnes to 53000 tonnes     Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550000 tonnes of wheat bran the officials said     The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)     But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership     Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada     Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation     Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports to improve tariffs for some other farm produce to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal     EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists: "We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough"     "We hope that there will be an improvement" he said  Reuter 

0,553,US military planners ruled out Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the Iran-Iraq war defense and Middle East experts said     US naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and raided another in what the administration called a "measured and appropriate response" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last Friday on a US-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters     Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig rather than an onshore economic or military target such as Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to limit the political military and diplomatic fallout both at home and in the Gulf     "It simply demonstrated the United States will take military action when they (Iran) take military action" Norman Polmar a defense analyst and author said     He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the embarrassment of casualties on its own soil possibly avoiding an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack     In addition it minimized the risk to US forces and the potential embarrassment of any losses including aircraft that could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack     Anthony Cordesman author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq war said the United States apparently chose a limited target to keep alive the possibility that UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a Security Council call for a ceasefire     "We want the UN peace initiative to work if there's any chance at all" he said adding that the action made it clear tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping     In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's economic lifeline Pentagon officials said the platform had been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the lower Gulf     "We have chosen a military target but we also have shown Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting capabilities" Cordesman said     He predicted the United States would respond to any future major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz followed by mining the approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island     Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran "but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures"  Reuter 

0,612,As official Washington sought to restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street collapse Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis     Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an international accord to stabilize currency values     Nigel Lawson British Chancellor of the Exchequer was among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors think that a clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy     Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday "I think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great That I think was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic" It was a dispute that should never have happened he added     Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday he still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United States on Tuesday Baker cut short a long-planned trip to Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis     Said one US analyst of Baker's weekend remarks "His timing could not have been worse"     One government bond salesman in New York said "He actually thought that yelling at the Germans and threatening to smack the dollar down would work That doesn't show much understanding of international monetary gamesmanship"     However some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand     "On the surface Baker may look responsible for this but if you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial markets) it was West German policy" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International in New York     "All Mr Baker did was to mention the obvious in public so making him responsible for it was a little like killing the messenger" he said     After Monday's talks the US and West German governments made it clear that the Louvre currency accord pieced together in Paris in February was still in effect     Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to the late 1970s Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values    Treasury sources said that Baker already unhappy about Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving was angered by a Bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite     He felt that the US recovery inching along in its 59th month could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion A growing US economy has been serving as a huge market for debtor country exports     Moreover Baker the consummate politician was worried that the Republican party might face next year's presidential election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly tarnished     A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off US economic growth that has already slowed to a tepid 32 pct annual rate     "There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy and it's important that the psychology turn around quickly or else obviously the panic will feed on itself and eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically" former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a television interview     In many ways the official response was mild     Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting that he was "puzzled"     US government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments and presumably their political impact     For all of this it seems unlikely that Baker's status in Washington will diminish because of the market fall     Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because of the Wall Street retreat Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen said with some irony "Oh I think it's much too late to be doing thatYou have an administration that's taken the attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and --- retire to the living room to take a nap You just can't do that"  Reuter 

0,727,New US Banking data suggest the Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path and is not signalling any imminent change of course economists said     But they also said that if money supply growth remains weak as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline suggests it may this could influence the Fed to loosen its credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary policy     A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June 8 with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a decline of four billion Instead M-1 fell eight billion dlrs to 7457 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate     Coming on the heels of a 43 billion decrease in M-1 for the week ended June 1 this means the nation's money supply has fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks economists said     "M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness" said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc     While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates M-2 and M-3 which are seen as better gauges of economic growth     Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges     If money growth does not accelerate Fed officials concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging could turn toward easier monetary policy economists said     "Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open market position? No" Sullivan said "But does this mean the end of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes"     Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period were lower than they had expected Most believed the Fed had targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs     But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day net miss in the Fed's reserve projections the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached     A drop in May US Housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the US Economy are lagging while a recent modest 03 pct gain in May producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears Slifer said     "If this continues we can entertain the notion of Fed easing at some point" he said     Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth "It has been a number of years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the economy" one said "I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is falling apart and the Fed should ease"     Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary policy     They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke off econmomic growth     But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late April "The Fed has to determine if this represents a fundamental change for the dollar If it does then this gives them more room to ease" he said  REUTER 

0,777,More UK Lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates     And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money     The decision to offer fixed rate loans industry officials said reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business     While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the UK They were the mainstay of the business in the US Up until only a few years ago     But in the early 1980s interest rates soared US Lenders mostly savings and loan associations were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts     As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds     "We very much have the example of the US Thrifts in mind" said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society explaining why his institution for the time being is only offering variable rate mortgages     The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more     Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for new business officials at all three institutions said     The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans     "Of course they are less profitable than other (variable rate) mortgages" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans     But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because "It was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product"     Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at 99 pct earlier this year     The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days according to a spokeswoman     "Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage" she said noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume     In short the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets     But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money     Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates fall further according to Duncan Young managing director     Young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument     But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being He said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably     However he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them This means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor     For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages In the US Where fixed rate mortgages are popular again securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years  REUTER 

0,804,US crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session     They said prices which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf     The US benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 2055 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market That is its highest level since January 1986     OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman who is Nigeria's oil minister said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review     Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises     Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting At that point barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies prices should begin easing     "OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm" said John Hill a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures     OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 166 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 183 mln barrels in the fourth quarter     This agreement helped send prices sharply higher rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December     Several OPEC members who are price hawks including Iran Algeria and Libya will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output     "And if US West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price" said Nauman Barakat analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co     But most analysts expect the more moderate producers such as Saudi Arabia to block any changes in policy     "The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC and in particular the Saudis are committed to stabilizing the market" said Rosario Ilacqua analyst with LF Rothschild     However some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions     Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 183 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500000 barrels to the market each day said John Lichtblau president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation     Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars so as the currency declines producers receive less money for their oil     "The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia" said Sanford Margoshes analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers     "In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 41 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting" he said     One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war     "The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf" said Frank Knuettel analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites     Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the US flag with naval escorts     "Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up" Knuettel said  Reuter 

1,862,President Reagan's nominee as top policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets     David Ruder a 58-year-old Republican law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston Ill was named Thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member US Securities and Exchange Commission     If confirmed by the Senate as expected he will succeed John Shad who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands     The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street     The investigation which is still active mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing     The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after Ivan Boesky one of Wall Street's most successful stock speculators agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading     But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities options and futures The price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some US securities markets     At the same time the SEC is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the US corporate landscape     And the agency is being pushed by US and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world around the clock     Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce US securities laws and guard investors from fraud     Under the leadership of Shad the SEC eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies eliminated many minor investor protection rules attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's review of hostile corporate takeovers     Shad who had been vice chairman of the E F Hutton investment banking firm brought a Wall Street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981     In line with the views of other top administration officials he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations     The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the administration of President Jimmy Carter a Democrat     Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission's current priorities     The SEC currently has about 2000 employees most of them lawyers and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff     The agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies investment banks and other securities firms it regulates     The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone     By law no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the White House     Established by Congress in 1934 the SEC traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929 which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms     The agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities     It requires brokers dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices     Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy an industrial magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy later to become the nation's 35th president     Other former chairmen include William Douglas who served from 1937 until his appointment to the US Supreme Court in 1939 and William Casey who served during President Nixon's first term and was Reagan's director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year  Reuter 

0,883,The economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in US exports should falter economists say     Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up they say     "These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?" said Lyle Gramley chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official     The Commerce Department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 48 pct annual rate in the first quarter but a US monetary official called it a weak report     Housing starts fell 27 pct in May and consumer spending rose a weak 01 per cent     "Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing -- are faltering but exports are picking up some of the slack " Martin Mauro senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics told Reuters     Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages     To offset this US exports must continue to rise returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption he says     "I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening but it is a close call" Gramley said     Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 48 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia     Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along "The pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be accommodative     Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession     Mauro said a 05 pct rise in industrial production in May came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry where an inventory overhang still exists     He says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper chemicals and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar     "They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity but I think they will keep us out of a recession" Mauro said     In a speech to financial planners this week Beryl Sprinkel the chief White House economic adviser predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve     "Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable" he said     But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation     Allen Sinai chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 45 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 11 pct increase in 1986     The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services he said     "The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle it continues to persist" he said adding he would like the Fed to tighten credit     A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar which should continue to fall and feed inflation says a prominent international banker     Rainer Gut chairman of Credit Suisse told the National Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the United States is the world's largest debtor nation     The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever "It is very difficult to be optimistic" Gut said  Reuter 

0,886,The six basis point rise of the past month in US debt futures may be extended next week by a series of US economic reports analysts said as long as the dollar holds firm     "Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis points over the last month largely over indications that inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing US trade balance in nominal terms" Samuel Kahan chief financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities said     Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in the economy during the first quarter but his concern is whether the US economy will sustain that strength in the longer term     Weak US economic growth could hurt the dollar which has become more important to the direction of debt futures than the beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy     The median trade expectations for Tuesday's US Consumer Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 04 pct and down 15 pct respectively     Meanwhile the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money supply announced this week was "surprising much larger than expected" according to Kahan "Unless quickly reversed" such a trend "will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative" Kahan said     Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which Kahan said have "slowed to a crawl below Federal Reserve Board annual targets" the consequences could be a hint of economic weakness down the road he said     Based on chart formations T-bond futures may be poised for further gains although the advance has been slowed recently analysts said     September T-bonds "are up almost six points since about May 18" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted September bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93 in mid-June Duggan said     While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through chart support the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted above the 93 level     "The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken out before this activity is anything other than a trading range market" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst Brian Singer said     The dollar remains the key fundamental factor and the US currency has made little headway of late analysts said     "The critical variable remaining in the market is the value of the dollar" Kahan said     Additional influences next week will be possible developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting and the impact and size of the US budget deficit "although these will not be in the forefront of the market early next week" Kahan said     In looking ahead to the US Treasury mini-refunding auctions of 2425 billion in T-notes on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday Singer said the market will likely greet the results with little excitement However a successful auction could prove to be a turning point depending on prevailing market psychology  Reuter 

0,1092,The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit banking economists and money market dealers said     The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future they said     The council will meet in Saarbruecken and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT     But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt and did not necessarily herald any policy moves     Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark     Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter     Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 350/70 pct range for most of this month after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 350 pct allocating funds at 355 pct     "They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further but not with the discount or Lombard" Winfried Hutmann chief economist of Schroeder Munchmeyer Hengst Investment GmbH said     Werner Chrobok managing partner at Bethmann Bank said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany     A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand with companies swimming in liquidity Chrobok said     The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates when this would be better held in reserve "The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder" he said     A cut in the discount or Lombard rates to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month would have little practical significance dealers said     The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit     But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere "eyewash"     Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit     But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further     "The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further" said Schroeder Muenchmeyer Hengst's Hutmann     Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy "But I don't expect any convincing measures" he said     Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today falling to 360/70 pct from 375/85 yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month-end distortions     Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers starting in the week beginning June 15 Two public holidays that week could also distort the market     Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 355 pct after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 350 pct and to fully replace the 55 billion marks in an outgoing pact     But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at 36 pct rather than 355 That would not represent a tightening of policy however     Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 36 pct dealers said     On another issue Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon     Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France and was twice under French occupation this century     But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes  REUTER 

0,1333,Some OPEC states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price and output pact in Vienna next week oil analysts say     They said Nigeria which holds the OPEC conference presidency and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive     There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices     But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity     "All OPEC members can make a good case for changing differentials" said one analyst with a major oil company "But at the end of the day the attitude is going to be "leave well alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered"     Iran Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year traders say But diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and in some cases marketing incentives have helped their sales     Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a "package"     Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced at least for some part of the year But many experts say OPEC should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades At its last meeting in December OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers     OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 158 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 166 mln for the third quarter and 183 mln for the fourth Analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months     Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials analysts say     The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one non-OPEC crudes OPEC assigned prices to its other key export crudes with a 265 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest Extra heavy crudes were among those left out     Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil exports actually sold at official prices Several experts say only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at official prices with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products     Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices    Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 1892 dlrs a barrel -- was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent     In February and March Nigeria's production shrank below its 1238 mln bpd OPEC quota Spot prices have since revived due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline and its output has risen     Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel     But Mehdi Varzi chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort Grieveson Securities doubts Nigeria will actively push the differentials question in Vienna     "It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria which holds the presidency raised the issue" he said  REUTER 
0,1334,Analysts said they were surprised at the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy statements and positive for the economy     Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs against a 195 billion deficit last year     Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus was even more positive than the most bullish analysts' forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets     Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a 23 billion dlr deficit But none predicted a surplus     The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and the foreign exchange markets one analyst said Paradoxically the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term despite lower interest rates as overseas investors became more confident about investing in New Zealand he said     However some foreign exchange dealers disagreed saying the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will move lower     The local dollar dropped to 05940/50 US Dlrs in after hours trading against 05970/77 just before the budget release     Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share market despite an increase in the contribution of company taxation to revenue figures     One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus announcement could push the share market up by 50 points tomorrow     The Budget statement was broadly as expected with a continuation of existing policies and the absence of traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively by overseas investors another said     But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share market particularly multi-national companies     The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements through bond tenders as a result of the surplus The requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln NZ Dlrs from a predicted 175 billion     Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure another economist said He added that the document seemed entirely credible     "Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects" he said     An election is due before the end of September  REUTER 

0,1370,A spokesman for the European Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax     Norbert Tanghe head of division of the Commission's Directorate General for Agriculture told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days "the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector  Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy"     The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable Tanghe said     Recent estimates put these costs at 40 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 20 billion Ecus he said In 1990 the Community's "standstill" agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement     The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system he added     Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced Tanghe said     Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level     He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy's oils and fats regime     "The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal" he said     Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT rules     It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats     EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements he said     The competitiveness between different oils whether EC produced or imported would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax Tanghe said     The proposed system would not alter the EC nations' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand he said     It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current import levels he said     Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals requirements which are not covered by the stabilising system Furthermore more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re-exported to third countries Tanghe added  Reuter 

0,1450,Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988 is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly lower growth higher unemployment and an increased trade deficit the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said     But the OECD in its half-yearly report forecast a slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years Last year Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growing economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 27 pct     The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987 but will then fall back to 25 pct in 1988     The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in import prices particularly oil an acceleration in labour costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure the report said     This year and to a lesser degree in 1988 domestic demand should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations     Domestic demand pressure coupled with the deterioration in Italian competitiveness is likely to stimulate imports and adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988 This could result in a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account  REUTER 

0,1471,Congress returned from its Easter recess ready for the annual Spring budget battle that promises to be a partisan dispute     The budget fight pitting Democrats against President Reagan and Republicans is expected to get underway this week in the Senate late this week and last at least another week It is taking on new prominence because of current trade woes     That is because the budget problems and its associated huge deficits are said to be at the root of related international trade friction currently worrying financiers     As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stock exchanges gyrate wildly the trade dispute involving the United States and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major trade war between the two trading giants for the first time since World War II     Ostensibly that dispute is over US charges that Japan is refusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and the resulting US tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisions and small computers     Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neither side wants is the dilemma of the US budget and its deficit     Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up to the economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue to grow without repercussions     A large portion of the US debt has been financed by foreigners from their accumulated trade surpluses But if they withdraw this support the result can only be further problems including higher interest rates for Americans     In a nutshell the US budget process has now moved to the showdown stages in Congress Reagan's own trillion dollar spending budget for the government year 1988 starting Oct 1 was trounced badly in the House on April 9     The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed the House calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171 billion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs through defense and domestic spending cuts and about 185 billion dlrs in new unspecified taxes As the Senate prepares to take up its own budget plan majority Democrats predict there will be passage of a bill only after a protracted partisan battle     In the House not one Republican voted for the budget which passed by 230 to 192 In the Senate none of Reagan's Republicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the Senate Budget Committee for full Senate consideration     A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters he believes this very unusual unanimous opposition was by design among congressional Republicans perhaps with the tacit approval of the White House     "Republicans want Democrats to take the heat for any tax hikes and defense cuts" he said     In the coming weeks the source said Democrats will press for a bipartisan budget and seek a negotiated budget with Reagan -- who already is opposed to the idea But "it is not clear how the Republicans will act" he added     He said Republicans may propose their own plan for lower taxes and more defense spending which they did not offer after Reagan's budget was clobbered in an early vote in the House      When Reagan entered the White House in 1981 he inherited what was labelled a huge deficit from Jimmy Carter that wound up to be nearly 79 billion dlrs that year     Despite Reagan's promise to balance the budget by 1983 critics note that his administration's record of accumulated debt is estimated over one trillion dlrs or 1100 billion dlrs     That is money the government must borrow and pay back and many analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and caused the worst US trade deficit ever      Last year the United States bought goods from the world worth 1698 billion dlrs more than what it sold including purchases of 586 billion dlrs in Japanese goods     While Congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on one front through a get-tough trade bill promising retaliatory measures unless all markets are opened its success so far against the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress     Congress which controls the pursestrings has put the deficit on a downward path from its record high of 2207 billion dlrs accumulated in fiscal 1986 which ended Sept 30     Because of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law enacted in late 1985 there has been pressure on Congress to do more than talk about deficits     That law named after Republican Senators Phil Gramm of Texas Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat Ernest Hollings of South Carolina calls for a balanced budget by 1991 through a series of set deficit targets that Congress must meet     The law has been followed even though an enforcement mechanism to mandate automatic across-the-board cuts if Congress misses its goal was stricken by the Supreme Court     The legislators have followed the targets -- on paper But in reality the goal has actually been missed For example Congress last year approved legislation to meet the 1987 target of a 144 billion dlr deficit But even after approving the numbers the deficit for 1987 is estimated at over 170 billion dlrs -- far off the target     This year the target is 108 billion dlrs and that goal is expected to

0,1473,Spanish Secretary of State for the economy Guillermo de la Dehesa said the government maintained its five pct inflation target for this year although a 06 pct increase in March pushed the rise in the year on year consumer price index to 63 pct     De la Dehesa said the March rise announced today by the National Statistics Institute was not entirely satisfactory but acceptable     The year on year rate at the end of February was six pct Prices rose 83 pct last year     The March rise included a 005 pct increase correcting an error in last January's consumer price index Economists had earlier said the error could have been as high as 02 pct     De la Dehesa said seasonal increases in food prices pushed the index up in March and he expected the rate to be lower in April     The Communist-led Workers Commissions union said the March price rise showed inflation was going up again and the government looked increasingly unlikely to meet its five pct target     The Workers Commissions said the inflation trend fuelled unions's claims to wage increases beyond the government's recomendation to limit wage rises at around five pct     Spain is being affected by a two-month-old wave of strikes for wage rises Government officials note wage settlements so far this year have yielded average increases upwards of six pct while unions say the figure is higher then seven pct  REUTER 

0,1479,US banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy but they do support the market's assumption that the Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit economists said     "It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat Discount window borrowings net free reserves the Fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago Corp     Johnson and several other economists now estimate that the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct     Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were 935 mln dlrs a day producing a daily average for the two-week statement period of 689 mln dlrs the highest since the week of December 31 1986 and up from 393 mln dlrs previously     Moreover banks were forced to borrow a huge 52 billion dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the Fed had anticipated     However economists said it is almost certain that the Fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week They pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week     First economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes     As banks' checking-account liabilities rise so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed     Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 25 billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday but economists said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late     Second an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed economists said Thus although there were 103 billion dlrs of repos outstanding on Wednesday night the Fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so     "It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc     McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct     After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy     Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that the Fed was tightening policy But after reviewing today's figures he said "It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture"     Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate unless the dollar's fall gathers pace     Johnson at First Chicago agreed citing political opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to reducing the US trade surplus with Japan  Reuter 
